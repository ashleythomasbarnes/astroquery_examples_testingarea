    "# **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **ESO Archive Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ESO Science Archive Facility (SAF) is one of the largest ground-based astronomical data repositories in the world. It contains data from ESO telescopes at La Silla, Paranal, as well as the submillimeter APEX telescope on Llano de Chajnantor and the ALMA array. The archive includes all raw data from La Silla Paranal Observatory, the corresponding calibrations, and a wide range of processed data products, either generated by ESO or contributed by the community. It also hosts selected external datasets, such as raw WFCAM/UKIDSS data from the UKIRT facility in Hawaii. In addition to processed, science-ready data products, the archive provides access to raw observations, which are essential for researchers needing to reprocess data using custom pipelines, verify calibration, or explore previously unpublished results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Raw Data Access: Cross-Instrument vs Instrument-Specific Queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "ESO provides raw data access through two complementary querying strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-instrument queries via `dbo.raw`**  \n",
    "  This table aggregates metadata across all instruments, enabling broad searches that span multiple facilities. It is well-suited for general use cases, such as retrieving all observations of a target regardless of instrument. Here, however, the metadata is limited to common parameters across instruments like target name, observation date, and exposure time etc. The `dbo.raw` table does not include more instrument-specific parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instrument-specific queries via `ist.<instrument_name>`**  \n",
    "  Each instrument also has a dedicated table (e.g., `ist.muse`, `ist.midi`, `ist.harps`) offering detailed metadata specific to its configurations and observing modes. These tables expose additional diagnostic parameters (e.g., seeing, binning, readout modes, environmental conditions) not available in `dbo.raw`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While `dbo.raw` is optimized for uniform queries across the observatory, the `ist.<instrument>` tables are ideal for precision searches tailored to a single instrument’s performance and configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Purpose of This Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to explore and query **instrument-specific raw data tables** from the ESO Science Archive using **ADQL queries** in python with the ``pyvo`` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discover which instruments have dedicated raw metadata tables  \n",
    "- Inspect their available columns and field descriptions  \n",
    "- Construct refined **ADQL queries** to filter based on e.g. instrument-specific parameters such as seeing, airmass, detector binning, and moon illumination\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to identify relevant raw datasets and retrieve observation metadata with full control over instrument-specific filters."
